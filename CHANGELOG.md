# Changelog

All notable changes to Hearth are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
Hearth uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

While the version is below `1.0.0`, each planned milestone lands as a **minor**
bump and may include breaking changes; patch releases are fixes only.

| Version | Milestone |
|---|---|
| `0.1.0` | M1 — data model, extensible fields, CRUD, Google sign-in |
| `0.2.0` | M2 — one-way contacts push to Google |
| `0.3.0` | M3 — calendar push, attendee invites, RSVP writeback |
| `0.4.0` | M4 — field↔Google mapping settings, record sharing |
| `1.0.0` | All four milestones shipped and stable |

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `PGDATA_PATH` setting to bind-mount the Postgres data directory instead of
  using a Docker named volume. Needed on appliance hosts such as Unraid, where
  the volume store sits on a fixed-size `docker.img` that routine
  troubleshooting erases. Unset or empty keeps the previous named-volume
  behaviour, so existing installs are unaffected.
- Deployment guide for Unraid, covering the Google redirect-URI restriction on
  LAN addresses, pool paths versus `/mnt/user`, and getting the source onto a
  host with no `git`.
- `docker-compose.proxy.yml` overlay for running behind a reverse proxy. Joins
  the proxy's existing Docker network and fixes the container name, so the proxy
  can address Hearth as `hearth-app:3000` — Docker's embedded DNS only resolves
  container names on user-defined networks, so a shared network is the only way
  name-based upstreams work.
- `APP_BIND` setting to choose which interface the port publishes on. Set to
  `127.0.0.1` behind a proxy so the only route in is through TLS.
- `deploy/swag/hearth.subdomain.conf`, a ready-to-use SWAG proxy config with the
  Docker resolver (so the upstream survives container recreation) and response
  buffering disabled (so streamed renders are not held back).

### Fixed

- `scripts/docker-up.sh` no longer requires `node` or `git` on the host. It reads
  the version from `package.json` and the commit from `.git/` (loose refs and
  `packed-refs`) using only POSIX shell, so images built on Unraid, Synology or
  TrueNAS still carry a correct build stamp instead of reporting `unknown`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-07

First working release. The complete data model and CRUD application, plus the
groundwork the Google sync worker needs. **Nothing is sent to Google yet.**

### Added

- **People** with first/last name, nickname, organisation, job title, birthday
  and notes, plus unlimited repeatable contact details (emails, phones,
  addresses, links, social handles). The first email and phone of each person are
  treated as primary.
- **Relationships** between people, typed and directional. Each link is stored
  once and reads correctly from both ends — "Jack is the *parent of* Jill" renders
  on Jill's page as "*Child of* Jack". Twelve built-in types are seeded; users can
  define their own, symmetric or directional.
- **Events** with title, description, location, start/end, all-day and timezone.
  Times are entered as wall-clock times in the event's own zone and stored as
  absolute instants, so they survive daylight-saving changes.
- **Event attendance** linking people to events, each with a role
  (host / required / optional), an RSVP status, and a per-person "invite in
  Google" flag.
- **Extensible fields** on both people and events — text, long text, number,
  date, date & time, yes/no, single choice, multiple choice, email, phone and
  link. Defined in Settings and live immediately with no restart or migration.
  Fields can be required, carry help text, and appear as list-view columns.
  Archiving a field hides it while preserving stored values; deleting one erases
  its values from every record.
- **Google sign-in** via Auth.js, requesting granular
  `contacts` / `calendar.events` / `calendar.readonly` scopes rather than blanket
  calendar access, with `access_type=offline` so background sync can refresh its
  own token. Settings detects a grant missing scopes or offline access and
  prompts a reconnect.
- **"Add to Google"** on both record types, checked by default, with the default
  configurable per account.
- **Deletion bookkeeping.** Deleting a synced record, or unchecking "Add to
  Google", records the Google resource id in a tombstone queue *before* the local
  row disappears — so the remote copy can still be found and removed once the
  sync worker exists. Re-checking cancels an unprocessed tombstone.
- **Search** across people (name, organisation, job title, notes, contact
  details) and events (title, location, description, attendee names).
- **Docker packaging**: `docker compose up` runs the app plus Postgres 16. The
  entrypoint applies migrations and runs an idempotent seed on every start, so
  upgrades that add columns need no extra step.
- `GET /api/health` reporting database reachability and build identity.

### Notes

- Pinned to Next.js 15.5 rather than 16 so the toolchain also runs on Node 18.
  The container itself runs Node 22.
- Sync settings are saved and every record tracks its own sync state, but no
  requests are made to Google until `0.2.0`.
